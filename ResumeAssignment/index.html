          <h3>Vicious Cycles</h3>
          <img src="images/homePageInspirePic2.jpg" alt="Logo I created for the project">
          <p>This was a final project for my WEB 140 Web Development Fundamentals class, which was an introductory class for HTML and CSS. Our task was to make up a company and create a website for them. My idea was to create a faux multilevel marketing company that offered life-coaching services to reach "enlightenment." I also created the logo myself, basing it on the Starbucks logo, as I worked there at the time.</p>
          <p>While I chose to go a silly route with the actual company, I worked hard to make my project look as professional as possible and made sure the scripts worked. For it being my first major Web Development assignment, I believe it turned out very well.</p>

          <h3>SeReNiTy</h3>
          <img src="images/logo.png" alt="A cyclist overlooking a valley">
          <p>This was a final project for my WEB 110 Web Development Tools class. We were tasked with creating a website for a company called Vicious Cycles. We were given a small brief about the company, as well as its logo, but the rest was up to us to come up with.</p>
          <p>The project tested our creativity as well as our ability to confidently work in HTML and CSS. While there are many things I now know how to fix, I'm still proud of what I was able to accomplish here.</p>
